PositionFinder

James Stanko

Created April 2017. Takes Super Smash Brothers Melee stage files (.dat format) and searches a specified .dat file in the same folder as the exe for hex patterns.

These hex patterns are the position data, and the program will also feed back the hexadecimal offsets of these found positions, hence, "PositionFinder".
